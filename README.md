# Intrusion-Detection-using-ML-and-DL
### Here we have built a model using Machine learning and Deep learning which can detect on the basis of the input features viz, protocol types, service, bytes etc. whether there is an anomaly or not.
### We have built a Logistic Regression and an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) model which predicts whether there exists an anomaly based on the input fetures.
